Non-functional Requirements \u00b6 Identifier Name Description NFR1 Security Only authenticated and authorised users should be able to perform actions such as adding equipment, updating equipment location and information, or searching for specific equipment. NFR2 Performance The loading time should not hinder the user experience and productivity of the user in the website. The page/actions should have a loading time < 5 seconds on most computing environments on standard internet connections** NFR3 Maintainable and extensible The website should be relatively easy to update and extended to accomodate for new contexts. NFR4 Recoverable In the event of the web server or database server crashing, all stored data should be fully recoverable. NFR5 Intuitive user interface The website should have an intuitive / easy-to-use user interface, so that users will be able to easily use the website and update the equipment database NFR6 Compatibility The application should be compatible with recent versions of the major browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge) on laptop and desktop computers NFR7 Deployability The application should be compatible with deployment in the SHL VPS Proposed Solution \u00b6 The proposed solution is to build a custom web application that will encompass and satisfy the requirements (by completing the suggested \"ideal solution\" as per the Aim and Scope ). Some research for existing design solution has been done for this project see Appendix: Existing Design Solution . The beauty of custom web application for the team is that it upskills the current software engineers as aligned in the purpose of this unit, and the high possibility of extending application depending on the requirements without being constrained with the bulk of codebase of other unmaintained opensource projects. Comparatively to enterprise systems, most enterprise systems will charge per users that use the system, this easily becomes expensive because the amount of users that will use the system should be able to accomodate the number of users that are interested in looking for the assets.

The authentication system will be outsourced to the UWA Pheme Authentication API to allow any users in with a UWA Pheme account to login. Docker \u00b6 Docker is a deployment technology that allows virtualization in a server to allow the packaging of software into containers for deployment. To satisfy NFR7 - Deployability, the web platform will use docker to allow the deployment through the SHL VPS Server. Furthermore, Docker will be used for orchestration of different services in development to increase speed of development, and reduce inconsistency between developers devices (NFR3 - Maintainable and extensible). Code Quality \u00b6 The code quality will be ensured by peer reviews between the developers in the team. Code Storage and Development Control \u00b6 Git source control will be used, using the remote UWA System Health Lab organisational GitHub (NFR3 - Maintenace and Extensibility). Prototype \u00b6 See the Prototype mentioned in Figma Interface Prototype Execution Team \u00b6 The development of the web platform will be performed by Development and Methodology \u00b6 As per the staged requirement, majority of the development will take place on the stage 1 whereas stage 2 are feature-based requirements for the syste,.
